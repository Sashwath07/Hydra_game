# Hydra_game

Current base game functionality:
- Enemy spawns in waves (number of enemies per wave corresponds to the wave number)
- Enemy has health (takes standard turret 2 hits to destroy)
- Every enemy defeated adds $50
- Game over when an enemy reaches the base (start with 1 life)

TODO:
- Add levels
- Integrate other scenes
